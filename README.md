Hi gitties!!
I am now representing my very basic php program..
With this php program you can <br> <strong>Search and replace a word with another one</strong>

The first input will be shown on the placeholder in the text area region 
which can shown up you how n what you replace exactly. 


So lets do some rockzz 
<i>Thank you </i>
